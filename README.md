# UGA Virtual Reality 2025 – Portfolio – Demo 2: Rube Goldberg Physics Machine ⚙️

## Description
This project was created for the **University of Georgia Virtual Reality course** as part of my VR class portfolio.  
It demonstrates proficiency with **Unity’s physics engine** by creating a **chain reaction** of connected physical events driven entirely by physics interactions such as rigidbodies, colliders, and triggers.

## Core Features 🎮
1. **Chain reaction:** A series of at least **five distinct, connected physical events**.  

2. **Physics-driven design:** The entire reaction is **controlled by Unity’s physics engine**, not manual animation.  

3. **Dynamic interactions:** Events are linked using **collisions** and **triggers** to drive progression.  

4. **Final event:** A **trap cage** falls on the chicken and **activates a button**, which lights up green to signal completion.  

5. **Custom assets:** Models like the **white Pokéballs** were created in **Blender**.  

6. **Asset Store support:** Includes textures and models sourced from the **Unity Asset Store** (ground, walls, and chicken texture).
