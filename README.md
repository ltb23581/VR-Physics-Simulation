# Portfolio 1 – Demo 2: Rube Goldberg Physics Machine ⚙️

## Description 📚
This project demonstrates proficiency with Unity’s physics engine by creating a **chain reaction** of five connected events driven by rigidbodies, colliders, and triggers.

## Core Features ✨
1. A **chain reaction** of at least five distinct, connected physical events.  

2. The entire chain reaction is **physics-driven**, not manually animated.  

3. Connections between events rely on **physics interactions** such as **collisions and triggers**.  

4. The final event is a **trap**: a cage falls onto the chicken and activates a button, which lights up green to signify the end of the **chain reaction**.  

5. **Custom models**, such as the **white Pokéballs**, were created in Blender.  

6. The project uses several assets from the **Unity Asset Store**, including ground and wall textures and the chicken texture.
